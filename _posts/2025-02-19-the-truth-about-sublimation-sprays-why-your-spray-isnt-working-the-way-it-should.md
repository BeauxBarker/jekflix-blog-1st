Sublimation is an incredible way to transfer high-quality, full-color designs onto various surfaces. However, when it comes to **sublimation on cotton**, many crafters and businesses turn to **sublimation spray** as a solution. The problem? Most sublimation sprays on the market are nothing more than **rebranded wood finishes**—and that’s a serious issue.

## What Is Sublimation Spray?

**Sublimation spray for cotton** is designed to create a polymer-like layer on fabrics, allowing sublimation ink to bond with non-polyester materials. Without this layer, sublimation ink will simply wash out of cotton because it needs a polyester surface to adhere properly.

## The Wood Finish Connection: Why Most Sprays Are Inferior

Many so-called **sublimation coating sprays** are simply repurposed wood finishes, like polyurethane or acrylic coatings. Here’s why this is a huge problem:

1. **Not Designed for Fabrics** – Wood finishes are formulated to protect and seal porous materials like wood, not to create a flexible, breathable, and durable sublimation-ready surface on cotton.
2. **Cracking and Peeling** – Since wood finishes harden and create a stiff surface, applying them to fabrics can result in designs that **crack, peel, or feel rough**.
3. **Limited Washability** – Sublimation should be long-lasting, but when using a spray made from wood finish, the coating often **washes out quickly**, leading to faded or missing designs.
4. **Chemical Concerns** – Many wood finishes contain **harsh chemicals and VOCs** (volatile organic compounds) that aren’t meant to be in contact with skin, making them potentially unsafe for apparel and other personal-use items.

## The Alternative: Sublisnap – A True Sublimation Solution

Unlike traditional **sublimation sprays**, **Sublisnap** was developed specifically for sublimating on cotton and other non-polyester surfaces. Here’s why it’s superior:

* **Not a Rebranded Wood Finish** – Sublisnap is engineered for **fabric compatibility**, ensuring **a soft, flexible, and breathable** sublimation surface.
* **Long-Lasting & Washable** – Unlike sprays that peel or wash out, **Sublisnap holds up to washing and everyday wear**.
* **Safe & Non-Toxic** – Made with **sublimation in mind**, it doesn’t contain the same harsh chemicals as wood finishes.
* **Vibrant & Professional Results** – It enhances color vibrancy and detail, delivering **professional-quality prints** on cotton and more.

## Why This Matters for Your Business or Hobby

If you’re serious about sublimation, using **the right sublimation spray** can make or break your projects. Cheap alternatives masquerading as true sublimation solutions will leave you with frustrated customers, wasted time, and faded designs.
